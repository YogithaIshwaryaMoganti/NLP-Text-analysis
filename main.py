Determining the appropriate number of clusters depends on a variety of factors, taking into account the specific attributes 
of the data at hand. In the case of handling new articles or blog posts, they can be grouped into separate categories based 
on their content, which might include subjects such as sports, entertainment, and politics. Once these categories have been 
defined, one can employ different techniques like the elbow method and silhouette score to identify the optimal cluster quantity.

Q) Instead of looking at the average value in each variable individually, weâ€™ll just look at the top 6 words in each cluster. 
Compute the mean frequency values of each of the words in cluster 1, and 
then output the 6 words that occur the most frequently.
A) In cluster number 1, the word 'November' stands out as the most commonly occurring word when considering the average values.

Q) Which cluster could best be described as the cluster related to the Iraq war?
A) Based on the prominent words found in each cluster's output, it can be inferred that cluster 6 is 
somewhat more associated with the Iraq war.

Q) In 2004, one of the candidates for the Democratic nomination for the President of the United States was Howard Dean, 
John Kerry was the candidate who won the democratic nomination, and John Edwards with the running mate of John Kerry 
(the Vice President nominee). Given this information, which cluster best corresponds to the democratic party?
A) Cluster 4 contains the highest occurrence of terms such as 'dean,' 'kerry,' 'candidate,' 'democrat,' and 'edward,' 
suggesting a stronger connection to the Democratic party.
